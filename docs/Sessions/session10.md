# Session 10

## Circle of Life (cuz the boomers "died" you know)
* Uriel defeats the Hollow
* A wild Igor appears
    * Irena throws a Masterball
* The final boomer leaves
* Some goons kick baby Lyra's face and start a kerfuffle
* Everyone but Lyra get sucked into a black hole
* The goons are mind controlled?
